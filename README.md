### Unreal Assets Version Control

In this project I used [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/) for all the Unreal `Content/`, the files will be uploaded to my google drive instead of using the 1GB Github LFS free storage.

After DVC is installed, change to project directory, and simply execute command `dvc pull` to get files from remote.
